Simple app developed during my graduation that aims to demonstrate the 
transformation of an NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) into an 
DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton). The project strings are all in 
brazillian portuguese and the GUI is a very simple SWING construction.

I'm submitting with the eclipse project structure, so, to run, just 
checkout the project folder into your eclipse's workspace, go to 
"Import -> Existing Project Into Workspace" and select its folder. The 
main class is InterfaceAfnAfd.java.

Good luck!
